# Amazon-Top-50-Bestselling-Books
This is an EDA on Amazon's top 50 Bestselling Books
The libraries used were pandas to read the file, matplot lib and seaborn to plot the grapjs for the visualisations.
the motivation for the project was to determine what makes a book a best seller. 
Other hypotheses include : Who are the top five authors in the best selling list with the most number of books.
What is the distribution between the genre of books in the best selling list.?
Which genre of books has the most user rating?
Who are the top 10 authors with e=the maximum reviews?
In understanding the data, I looked at the number of rows and columns, the columns, the dimension of the data and the data types.
In order to prepare the data for analysis, the data was cleaned. 
There were no missing values in the data.
There were names of some authors that had been spelt wrong. Those were corrected.
Another part of cleaning the data was removing duplicates in the Column withnthe names of the books to make sure there were no repetitions that will misrepresent the analysis.
I did some categorigal insights to determine the top five books with the highest price, top 5 authors with the highest ratings, top 5 books with the highest user ratings, top five books with the lowest ratings, top five books with the highest and lowest reviews, top 5 authors with the most books
The EDA we did showed the count of fiction against non fiction in the best sellers list. This showed a 54.4% against 45.6% which shows that Non Fiction has a higher distribution.
Also, the EDA for the distribution of the user ratings among the genre showed that fiction books have lesser ratings than non fiction books.
The top five authors have books ranging from 12 books to 7 books amongst the list. Jeff Kinney tops the list. 
The top five books with the highest reviews range from about 80,000 reviews to about 50,000 reviews. 'Where the Crawdads sing' tops the list. The books with the lowest user ratings range from 3.5 to 3.8.
Non Fiction books also generally have higher prices than fiction books according to the EDA.
Lastly, there is no correlation between the year a book was realeased , price, ratings and reviews of a book.
Overall People tend to read more fictional books than non-fictional books this could be because the price is lower as compared to non-fictional books. 
Another reason could be because of the reviews and ratings. |The books with the highest reviews and ratings are all non fictional.
